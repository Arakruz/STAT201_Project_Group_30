# STAT201_Project_Group_30
## Set up 
1. Open JupyterHub from Canvas(or login to cybera.syzygy.ca)
2. **IMPORTANT**: If you access JupyterHub from Canvas you might be inside the STAT 201 folder, if so, you should LEAVE the STAT 201 folder before proceeding, creating a folder inside of STAT 201 might cause error for accessing your Worksheets and Tutorials. 
4. Click the Git icon (shape of a diamond) on the left size of screen
5. Click the third option "Clone Repository"
6. Paste in the HTML link to GitHub repository, follow the instructions
7. **IMPORTANT**: make sure the folder is not inside of STAT 201!
8. Now you should be able to access the repository and edit away!

## Personal Access Token(PAT)
- You will be asked for a PAT when commiting a change, the PAT can be generated following the steps outlined in the document below
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

## Note
- Workflow refresher: pull changes -> edit -> add .ipynd (NOT the checkpoint) to stage area -> commit -> push 

## CheckList for things to have in our proposal
Introduction 
- [ ] Backgroud information
- [ ] Identify and describe the dataset
- [ ] Clearly state question of interest
- [ ] Clearly state one location parameter (mean, median, quantile, etc.)
- [ ] Clearly state one scale parameter (standard deviation, inter-quartile range, etc.)
- [ ] Justify your choice 

Result 
- [ ] Demonstrate that the dataset can be read from the web into R.
- [ ] Clean and wrangle your data into a tidy format.
- [ ] Plot the relevant raw data, tailoring your plot in a way that addresses your question.
- [ ] Compute estimates of the parameter you identified across your groups. Present this in a table. If relevant, include these estimates in your plot.

Method
- [ ] A brief description of “the good things” about this report – specifically, in what ways is this report trustworthy?
- [ ] Explaining why the plot(s) and estimates that you produced are not enough to give to a stakeholder
- [ ] What you should provide in addition to address this gap
- [ ] Minimum one hypothesis test
- [ ] Minimum one confidence interval 
- [ ] Compare the bootstrapping and asymptotics methods.
- [ ] What do you expect to find in the final report?
- [ ] What impact could such findings have?
- [ ] What future questions could this lead to?
