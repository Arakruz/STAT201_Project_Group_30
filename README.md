# STAT201_Project_Group_30
## Goal 
- Preliminary Analysis \
        1. Obtain the number of crime incidents grouped by day for each neighbourhood\
        2. Obtain the averge daily crime incidents for each neighbourhood\
        3. Obtain the median daily crime incidents for each neighbourhood\
        4. Obtain the standard deviation for daily crime incidents for each neighbourhood\
        5. Obtain the average number of crime incidents per year for each neighbourhood\
        6. Obtain the median number of crime incidents per year for each neighbourhood\
        7. Which neighbourhood is the most crime prone, has the highest average daily crime incident rate?\
        8. Which neighbourhood is the safest, has the lowest average daily crime incident rate?\
        9. Is the average daily crime rate in the most crime prone neighbourhood significantly higher than the safest neighbourhood?
- Visualization\
        1. Ideas?
## CheckList for things to have in our proposal
Introduction 
- [ ] Backgroud information
- [ ] Identify and describe the dataset
- [ ] Clearly state question of interest
- [ ] Clearly state one location parameter (mean, median, quantile, etc.)
- [ ] Clearly state one scale parameter (standard deviation, inter-quartile range, etc.)
- [ ] Justify your choice 

Result 
- [x] Demonstrate that the dataset can be read from the web into R.
- [x] Clean and wrangle your data into a tidy format.
- [x] Plot the relevant raw data, tailoring your plot in a way that addresses your question.
- [ ] Compute estimates of the parameter you identified across your groups. Present this in a table. If relevant, include these estimates in your plot.

Method
- [x] A brief description of “the good things” about this report – specifically, in what ways is this report trustworthy?
- [x] Explaining why the plot(s) and estimates that you produced are not enough to give to a stakeholder
- [x] What you should provide in addition to address this gap
- [x] Minimum one hypothesis test
- [x] Minimum one confidence interval 
- [ ] Compare the bootstrapping and asymptotics methods.
- [x] What do you expect to find in the final report?
- [x] What impact could such findings have?
- [x] What future questions could this lead to?

## Set up 
1. Open JupyterHub from Canvas(or login to cybera.syzygy.ca)
2. **IMPORTANT**: If you access JupyterHub from Canvas you might be inside the STAT 201 folder, if so, you should LEAVE the STAT 201 folder before proceeding, creating a folder inside of STAT 201 might cause error for accessing your Worksheets and Tutorials. 
4. Click the Git icon (shape of a diamond) on the left size of screen
5. Click the third option "Clone Repository"
6. Paste in the HTML link to GitHub repository, follow the instructions
7. **IMPORTANT**: make sure the folder is not inside of STAT 201!
8. Now you should be able to access the repository and edit away!

## Personal Access Token(PAT)
- You will be asked for a PAT when commiting a change, the PAT can be generated following the steps outlined in the document below
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

## Note
- Workflow refresher: pull changes -> edit -> add .ipynd (NOT the checkpoint) to stage area -> commit -> push
